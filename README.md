## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- The motivation for this project was to provide individuals with accesibility needs a more accessible website to with comprehensive and friendly UI. 
- With the changes I've implemented, it will provide users with sight impairments to utilize text to speech programs to understand and visualize everything on the page, including pictues and graphics.

## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    
    ![alt text](assets/screenshot/screencapture-localhost-52331-index-html-2021-12-02-19_00_44.png)
    Screencapture kept bugging and throwing in that mans arm over the image a second time.
